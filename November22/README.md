## Discussion of "Digital Theatre"

## Ideas for "Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs" 
My idea for the play is to create a sci-fi setting for the play to make the audience engage in the play including robots as dwarfs.

### Main Characters

Snow White (Prefer human actress, Boston Dynamic Dog will also be fine)
Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey (All robots)

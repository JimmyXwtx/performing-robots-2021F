## Ideas for "Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs" 
My idea for the play is to create a sci-fi setting for the play to make the audience engage in the play including robots as dwarfs. This play will include many human robot interactions. The main plot will cover the process of Snow White getting to know the dwarfs through interaction.

### Main Characters

Snow White (Prefer human actress)

Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey (All robot dwarfs)

### Plots

1. A neopixel magic mirror informs the queen Snow White is the most beautiful one in the world.
2. Snow White comes to the stage and rushes to avoid being killed. She enters the robot world.
3. Snow White finds the dwarfs' house and seven robot dwarfs rings her. They turn in a circle and the lights contained do not turn on (show their confusion). She has to activate them to protect her.
4. Snow White interacts with dwarfs and gets trust from them. Dwarfs' lights turn on to introduct themselves to Snow White.
5. The neopixel pad comes to stage again as a door and handles the poisoned apple to Snow White. Snow turns to the "sleeping death".
6. Robot dwarfs are so worried that they move in a chaoic setting and even run into each other and fall to the ground. One dwarf succeed to find their prince - the Spot!
7. After Snow White wakes up, all the robot dwarfs surround her and repeat the interactions done before with her and come to the audience for similar interaction.

## Response for _One Stage: Robots as Performers_

1. Appreciate the analysis of why stage performance is a good testing ground for HRI research.
2. "Untrained human" sounds interesting for me, what is its differnence from trained human?
3. Can robots just play as a robot in a robotic setting instead of in human environments?
4. Is it possible to develop a general rule of acting method and theory of design guidelines and cues for robot acting?
5. I think the most important reason why "anticiparoty timing and gesture-based opportunistic improvisation" would be effective to improve the robot performance fluency is that it can make the robots alive for audience (always processing the inputs, responding quickly, interactive...) instead of an inflexiable machine.
6. Will those partial information enough for robots to generate accurate response? Will that lead to disruptive response?
7. Will the changing process based on the imcomplete information be treated as a failure in performance for audience?

## Idea for the robot play


Propose an idea for a robot play or a scene from a play.
Your play may use one or more robots that we will build
One or two robot dogs (Boston Dynamic Spot)
Your play may be based on a play that already exists or you may make up something on your own
Consider why a robot should perform in this role. Some suggestions:
Can robots be used to explore topics that are too difficult for humans (e.g. difficult conversations)?
Can robots be used to explore human-robot coexistence (an idea mentioned in Katie's presentation today)?
Write this up in the same README.md mentioned above
Include sketches or pictures of robots and/or scenery if you wish. Hand drawn is fine.

## Response for _One Stage: Robots as Performers_

1. Appreciate the analysis of why stage performance is a good testing ground for HRI research.
2. "Untrained human" sounds interesting for me, what is its differnence from trained human?
3. Can robots just play as a robot in a robotic setting instead of in human environments?
4. Is it possible to develop a general rule of acting method and theory of design guidelines and cues for robot acting?
5. I think the most important reason why "anticiparoty timing and gesture-based opportunistic improvisation" would be effective to improve the robot performance fluency is that it can make the robots alive for audience (always processing the inputs, responding quickly, interactive...) instead of an inflexiable machine.
6. Will those partial information enough for robots to generate accurate response? Will that lead to disruptive response?
7. Will the changing process based on the imcomplete information be treated as a failure in performance for audience?

## Idea for the robot play

My idea was inspired by the movie _Arrival_ which was based on the science fiction _Story of Your Life_. It is basically about how a linguist communicates with aliens and succeeds to decipher their language and to predict the future. It finally discusses the topic of free will: "What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?" Knowing the future but cannot change it implies no free will.

I will choose to use an emergency intelligencer (smarter one...), a Boston Dynamic Spot dog, a signalling robot and a human for performance.

As the robot dog from Boston Dynamic Spot looks so similar to the alien in the movie, with its legs flexible and surreal, I prefer the dog to act as the alien. Apart from the apperance, I think robots can better act as aliens because people will recognize they are differennt species from us at the first glance, and that Boston Dynamic Dog looks hard to understand, which is in line with the feelings when the linguist first saw the alien. When it comes to the plot that they finally understand each other, I think it will be a good illustration of the coexistence between human and alien/robots.

The main plot will be:

1) The alien dog comes onto the stage.
2) The emergency intelligencer shows emergency status (beat and move). The alien dog moves around and seems to be afraid.
3) The signalling robot with the neopixel come to the front of the alien dog and starts to show strange circles.
4) But seems nobody can understand, the emergency intelligencer starts to find someone who might understand.
5) Human linguist comes onto the stage with the intelligencer (still with red light but calms down).
6) Human actor takes a pad to show the alien dog human language word, and the alien dog nods it head to show it can understand.
7) Human actor tells the alien dog to show the word in its alien language (strange circles) through the signalling robot, and she continues to learn that language.
8) Human actor now understands the alien language and she realizes that is a language without time limitation and can predict the future.
9) Human actor shakes hand with the alien dog. And the emergency intelligencer turns to normal.

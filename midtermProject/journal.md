## Midterm Project -- Lost Alien

My robot will be a rotating machine with a cute shiny alien head which will shake when it rotates. The illustration prototype is visualized here:

**Actuators needed:** 2 DC motors, NeoPixel matrix.

**Building parts (ideal):** It will have a circular body built with cardboard, arduino uno, batteries and H-bridge. Two DC motors will be sticked onto it and linked with two wheels. Another wheel will also be attached but without motor to make things easier. For the head part, I will make four springs to hold the NeoPixel so that it will shake with movement. Hope those solid wires will help me make the springs. On the Neopixel board, I intend to make a dome-like cover to serve as the cute head of the robot, and light should be transfer through the material.

**How it will be expressive:** The emotion will be demonstrated through the rotation and light change. For instance, when the robot is calm, it will stand still and with its blue head shining. Then something frustrated or annoying happens. Its head will blink with yellow light to show the emergency status. Then it will rotate quickly and its head will turn read with the movement. More advancedly with the romote control, I can use the potentiometer to trigger the emergency status with rotation. Maybe I can add a sound part to build the senario.

**Current Progress and What Left:**

1. Use solid wires to make springs. Connect it to the NeoPixel.

2. Use hot glue gun to stick the motors to the board. Make a flexible wheel which took a long time. I use the coffee stirrers to link the wire and use tapes to make the pipeline. **Problems: Hard to arrange things, a breadboard is used as the GND on the arduino board is not enough. (Maybe can solder them to make it take less space) Batteries are heavy and it make the board fold. (Add solid sticks on the back and cut the angle of cardboard.)**

3. Add the Neopixel board to the main machine via several pillars made from toilet paper tube. **(Head cover missed, still finding appropriate material)**

4. Built radio remote control. Current progress is click the button, the robot starts to rotate. **(Neopixel Sequence Missing. Will made that later. More coding later.)**

5. Rearrange differnet parts of the robot and fix them on the main body, making it more easier to work with the wires.

Less messy now!

6. Resolder the wires for Neopixel as the original one is too short, test the Neopixel, build the curcuit. **(Learning the Neopixel coding...)**

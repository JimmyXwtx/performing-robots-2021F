Character I choose is the rose from Le Petit Prince, one of the most famous novel and play in the world. I initially want to find more human character for robots to play such as Julien from Le Rouge et le Noir, but I found without spoken words, it would be really hard for audience to understand who the robot is performing.

Here is the link for the video of the play: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Vy4y1k71Z?from=search&seid=9459395192638798656&spm_id_from=333.337.0.0

**Technical features:** Rose is easier to construct and easier for the audience to know what it is at first glance. I would like to use white paper with solid wires in it to build the rose. The actor Rose will be able to rotate (rise from ground to 30cm high), its petals can open and close according to its emotion (use servo motor and strings to drag the petals), and its color should also be able to change to show its emotion (include a led to put light on the white paper).

**Sequence:** Here is an illustration for the design:

**How To Make It:** The rose will be constructed by solid wires and paper, which will make its petals easy to fold. I will use the servo motor and strings to drag the rose to open. I will use a DC motor to make the whole rose to rotate. Led will be used to change the color of the rose.

**Other Features and Decorations:** A voiceover will be added to help the audience understand the plot. Examples include "the prince cultivated a rose", "the rose grew to open", "some conflict happens and the prince left", "the prince realized his rose was a common rose, but it was his rose, it was time devoted to him that made it so important."

I will add colors using pen to the leaves and the body of the rose. I will also find a case to hold the rose

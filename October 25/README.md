Character I choose is the rose from Le Petit Prince, one of the most famous novel and play in the world. I initially want to find more human character for robots to play such as Julien from Le Rouge et le Noir, but I found without spoken words, it would be really hard for audience to understand who the robot is performing.

Rose is easier to construct and easier for the audience to know what it is at first glance. I would like to use white paper with solid wires in it to build the rose. The actor Rose will be able to rotate (rise from ground to 30cm high), its petals can open and close according to its emotion (use servo motor and strings to drag the petals), and its color should also be able to change to show its emotion (include a led to put light on the white paper).

Here is an illustration for the design:



Choose a short scene from a play and a character in that scene, and consider how you would make a robot actor to perform that scene. Any spoken words will come from a human or a computer, not from your actor.
How would you build the actor?
What technical features will the actor need?
How will you construct the actor to create the role?
How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?
What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?

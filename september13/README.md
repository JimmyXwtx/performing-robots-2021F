## Two motors with a switch to a control

I connect two monors to the H-bridge, and build a circuit with a button to control them. When the button is on, two motors run. This work is built on the in-class example with one motor and the built-in example of button.

Here is the link for [the documentation video](https://youtu.be/QRJX0foDIA0).

The arduino file is also uploaded in this folder.

Difficulties I have met is those messy wires. I spent some time to arrange it and make it flexible. Maybe next time I will use some longer wires instead of those jump wires.
